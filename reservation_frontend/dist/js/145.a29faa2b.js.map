While this number is spread across the 184 offices\r\n      country-wide, if you add to this the number of marriages, divorces,\r\n      deaths, citizenship and other services Home Affairs offers, you can\r\n      understand just how many people frequent home affairs each day. This of\r\n      course results in long queues, some times starting as early as 5am.\r\n      <br /><br />\r\n      To alleviate the strain this has on our clients, Home Affairs began\r\n      offering online booking in 2022 allowing clients to register and\r\n      thereafter make an appointment at a specific time thereby by-passing the\r\n      need to arrive hours before you are able to meet with staff.\r\n      <br /><br />\r\n      It was our hope that this would create more pleasant opportunities for\r\n      both our clients as well as our staff and since then, this has been the\r\n      case for many South Africans.\r\n      <br /><br />\r\n      While the current booking system is not equally accessible to all South\r\n      Africans, we the Department of Home Affairs hope to extend the booking\r\n      options to cellphones so that the absolute majority of South Africans can\r\n      enjoy the benefits of the eBooking service.\r\n    </h5>\r\n    <h3 class=\"mainBrwnTxt\">Home Affairs eBooking - Easy to use, convenient and just a click away</h3>\r\n  </div>\r\n</template>\r\n","import { render } from \"./AboutView.vue?vue&type=template&id=1387344a\"\nconst script = {}\n\nimport exportComponent from \"../../node_modules/vue-loader/dist/exportHelper.js\"\nconst __exports__ = /*#__PURE__*/exportComponent(script, [['render',render]])\n\nexport default __exports__"],"names":["class","script","__exports__","render"],"sourceRoot":""}
