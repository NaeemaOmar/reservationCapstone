    <h5>
      The Department of Home Affairs, as one of the vital departments in South
      African government has always been inundated with a large number of
      clients. <br /><br />
      For registration of birth alone, with 1 003 307 births in 2020 and about
      240 working days, the department would need to process on average, 4180
      births a day. While this number is spread across the 184 offices
      country-wide, if you add to this the number of marriages, divorces,
      deaths, citizenship and other services Home Affairs offers, you can
      understand just how many people frequent home affairs each day. This of
      course results in long queues, some times starting as early as 5am.
      <br /><br />
      To alleviate the strain this has on our clients, Home Affairs began
      offering online booking in 2022 allowing clients to register and
      thereafter make an appointment at a specific time thereby by-passing the
      need to arrive hours before you are able to meet with staff.
      <br /><br />
      It was our hope that this would create more pleasant opportunities for
      both our clients as well as our staff and since then, this has been the
      case.
      <br /><br />
      While the current booking system is not equally accessible to all South
      Africans, we the Department of Home Affairs hope to extend the booking
      options to cellphones so that the absolute majority of South Africans can
      enjoy the benefits of the eBooking service.
