          The Department of Home Affairs is proud to announce its latest
          collaboration with technology: solving the unbearably long queues by
          setting up its online booking system. This system allows clients of
          Home Affairs to book their session subject to staff availability and
          load-shedding thereby completely elimination the need to queue for
          hours at a time.

        Welcome to the new Home Affairs online booking process This easy-to-use
        process allows you to set up an appointment for your Home Affairs needs
        such as applying for a passport, new ID, smart ID and much more. <br> <br> All you
        need to do is register your details and then pick a time and date that
        suit your needs. <br> <br> In the unfortunate event that the system is down on the day of your appointment or there is unexpected load-shedding that will
        affect your appointment, you will receive an sms informing you of such.
        This will give you the option of either staying until the issue is
        resolved or rescheduling for a different day
